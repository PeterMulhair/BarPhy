# BarcodePlacer
This script is used required when an expected species ID does not match the result species ID from a sequence similarity search agains the [BOLD](https://www.boldsystems.org/index.php) database. It requires a merged barcode sequence as input, along with an expected species ID (EXID) and a result species/genus ID (REXID). Using the BOLD API it pulls down barcode data for EXID and REXID, creates a multiple sequence alignment, and constructed a phylogenetic tree. The output is a pdf image of the tree, where the identification of the barcode query can be confidently assigned in a phylogenetic context.
